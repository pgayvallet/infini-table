# InfiniTable

Work in development


## Compatibility

- IE 9+ (yea sorry for some people, but seriously who forced you to keep IE8 compat )
- Any other recent browser ( won't work on lynx for example )

Seriously, this has been tested on Chrome 29+, FireFox 25+, IE9, IE10, Opera,
Also working on iOS browser, Android browser, Chrome for android, even if mobile devices are not exactly the main target for a killing table component.

## Dependencies

Actually, InfiniTable depends on the following :

- jQuery (either 1.9 or 2.0)
- jQuery UI (specifically the following components : core, widget, mouse, position, draggable) but NOT for any of the sh**y jQuery UI CSS.
- UnderscoreJS ( did not try with lodash but should not cause any issue )
- FontAwesome

Pretty much all these dependencies will soon be removed, at the exception of jQuery and underscore.
